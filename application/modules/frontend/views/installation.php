  <h1>Metropolis</h1>
<p>Metropolis, the mother city, city of mothers, mother of all cities.   The city, the film… they too are machines.
<p>Flywheels, a crankshaft, an eccentric disk.
<p>A machine without Workers, devoid of function, pure movement… rotating, thrusting… a machine of desire. 
<p>Round shapes and jerking movements become one within the image of two clocks. One-hour and one-hour clock. Day shift and night shift, hours each, mark the Metropolis working day.
<p>Two groups of Workers, uniformed, in rows of six, march in unison, the exhausted half as fast as the fresh.
<p>The Workers' theme - a funeral march. The night shift enters a cage… the grate is raised, the cage sinks, and with it the camera.           <p>A title picks up the movement. The title's movement is carried through to the movement of the picture.
<p>The Workers: Now just a painted silhouette rising in the background, the design of the Underground Workers' City.
<p>Elevators transport the Workers up and down between the machine halls and their living quarters.  A new musical theme: The Theme of the City of the Workers.
<p>The main square of the Workers' City. Simply a transit area for the Workers returning to their quarters.  In the centre a gong,             again a kind of alarm clock.
<p>The downward scroll of the title is answered by a rising, equilateral triangle pointing skywards.
<p>The Sports stadium, the contrast is stark between its openness under sweeping skies and the cramped City of the Workers - just as stark as the contrast between the liberated and carefree movements  of the youths, dressed in white, and the dull lethargy  of the darkly clothed Workers - and the self-determined horizontal  movement versus the downward ride of the Workers in the lift.
